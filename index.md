A trial will be conducted to study the reaction time in young male subjects. The experimental setting aims at studying the fasting condition versus post-prandial condition. The outcome variable of interest is the reaction time. Some preliminary studies show that reaction time for fasting is about 100 [ms] with a standard deviation of 30 [ms]. The expected change after a meal is an increease of 30 % in reaction time. The study design is a two group superiority trial. The study has a balanced designed. The test will be perform conservativelly with two tails and in an unpair setting. We will use the classical levels of power and alpha (80% and 5% respectivelly.)
