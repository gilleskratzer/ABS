As	part	of	ongoing	efforts	to	reduce	waste and	increase	the	reproducibility of	animal	research	and	testing, a set of guidelines have been	produced	for	planning	animal	experiments:

*[PREPARE](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0023677217724823) (Planning	Research	and	Experimental	Procedures	on	Animals:	Recommendations	for	Excellence)*

*[ARRIVE](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000412) (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines are intended to improve the reporting of research using animals â€“ maximising information published and minimising unnecessary studies.*

# Hands-on excercies:

### Warm up question: Why doing a sample size prior to your study?

Estimate the required sample size using [this web app](http://powerandsamplesize.com/).

A trial will be conducted to study the reaction time in young swiss male subjects. The experimental setting aims at studying the fasting condition versus the post-prandial condition. The outcome variable of interest is the reaction time in milliseconds [ms]. Some preliminary studies show that reaction time for fasting is about 100 [ms] with a standard deviation of 30 [ms]. The expected change after a meal is an increase of 30 % in reaction time. The study design is a two-group superiority trial. The study has a balanced designed. The test will be performed conservatively with two tails and in an unpair setting. We will use the classical levels of power and alpha (80% and 5% respectively.)

### 1. Estimate the require sample size for a parametric approach

### 2. Estimate the new required sample size if SD is reduced by 20%

### 3. Estimate the new sample size is the SD is 30 [ms] but the expected change is an increase of 36 [ms]

### 4. Estimate the new sample size if you decide to use a paire designed

### 5. Estimate the power achieved with 10 subject per group in an unpaired design
