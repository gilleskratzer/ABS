Hands-on exercies for the Animal Science and Ethics Day in Bern. 

Estimate the required sample size using [this web app](http://powerandsamplesize.com/).

A trial will be conducted to study the reaction time in young swiss male subjects. The experimental setting aims at studying the fasting condition versus the post-prandial condition. The outcome variable of interest is the reaction time in milliseconds [ms]. Some preliminary studies show that reaction time for fasting is about 100 [ms] with a standard deviation of 30 [ms]. The expected change after a meal is an increase of 30 % in reaction time. The study design is a two-group superiority trial. The study has a balanced designed. The test will be performed conservatively with two tails and in an unpair setting. We will use the classical levels of power and alpha (80% and 5% respectively.)


### 1. Estimate the require sample size for a parametric approach

### 2. Estimate the new required sample size if SD is reduced by 20%

### 3. Estimate the new sample size is the SD is 30 [ms] but the expected change is an increase of 36 [ms]

### 4. Estimate the new sample size if you decide to use a paire designed

### 5. Estimate the power achieved with 10 subject per group in an unpaired design
